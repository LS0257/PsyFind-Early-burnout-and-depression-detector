# The HTML mentions a Random Forest model, which is typically saved 
# as a pickle (.pkl) file or similar. It's usually best practice NOT 
# to version control large binary model files.
# If these files are large, un-track them. If they are small and 
# required for the app to run without re-training, you might commit 
# them, but generally exclude them.
